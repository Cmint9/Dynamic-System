# Dynamic-System
This is my Applied Math research, I want to share what we did in this research.
### What did we explore? 
ðŸ“ˆOur research was conducted by utilizing Mathematica to observe the changes that occur in a person's body when they encounter different difficulties and blows, and how they will react. We adjusted the variables for different levels to predict and observe the response curves of people under varying levels of encounters.
